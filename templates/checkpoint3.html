    The Pizza Golem drops the Pizza Cutter it wielded.

    "Well," Toni says, "I suppose you're not as weak as I thought you were, but still weak nonetheless."

    He chuckles and says "well, you’ve seen behind the scenes of my success. Let me let you in on a secret- Toni is actually
    my middle name. My real name, and what my followers call me, is FATHER JOHN" and he transforms, wearing a dark robe,
    crackling with dark necrotic lightning bolts. "Not cheesy enough for you yet? It’s time you learn how the sausage gets
