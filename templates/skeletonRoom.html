    <h5>{{where}}</h5>
    <br>

    You walk through the wooden door and see another open room, this time with 3 skeletons and a steel door on the other
    side of the room.
    <br><br>
    One is growing delicious looking mushrooms and wearing a shirt that says "I’m a fungi!"  He then says "My name's Hans,
    and I've got a bone to pick with you."
    <br><br>
    Another has green bones and a red skull, giving the appearance of an olive. "Olive you suck! Get it? Because of olives?"
    <br><br>
    The final skeleton is wearing a blue hoodie and pink slippers, and simply calls you pond scum.
    <br><br>
    Your only option is to <a href="/battle/skeletons/">battle</a> them.
