    You find yourself in the Hut of Pizza, a small run-down shack
    <br>
    The owner, Tom Boli, comes up to you: "Interested in an adventure?" he asks.

    <div class="hidden" id="respondYes">
    "Alright.  We're going to bring down Pizzaroni Toni," Boli explains, "Toni has stolen my business and destroyed all
    other pizza business in town apart from the Hut of Pizza and his own.  I know he's hiding some demonic secret, so
    we'll have to be careful.  <a href = '/game/mansion_front'>Let's go.</a>"
