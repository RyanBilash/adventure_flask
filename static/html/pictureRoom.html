    You find yourself in a large room with a wooden platform in the center, two paths leading to doors on either end of the
    room.  You walk onto the platform and a camera lowers alongside a sign saying "say cheese for your picture!"
    <br>
    <button id="cheeseButton">Say Cheese</button>
    <button id="nothingButton">Do Nothing</button>

    <div id="succeedDiv" class="hidden">
        You say cheese, you smile, the camera flashes, and the other door opens.
        <br><button id="continue">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="fallDiv" class="hidden">
        You wait, when the floor falls out from under you.  You fall into what appears to be a pit of boiling/molten cheese,
        but it doesn't hurt you.
        <br><button id="climbButton">Try to Climb Out</button>
        <br><button id="searchButton">Look Around</button><br>
        <div id="searchDiv" class="hidden">You look around the pit, eventually finding a small pebble.  When you pick up the pebble, the
            molten cheese is revealed to just be water, and the pebble is magically making it appear like cheese.<br></div>
        <div id="climbFail" class="hidden">You start to climb up, but fall back down.</div>
        <div id="climbSuccess" class="hidden">You successfully climb out of the pit.
            <br>
            <button id="continuePit">Continue On</button>
