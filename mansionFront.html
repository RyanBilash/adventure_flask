    <h3>{where}</h3>

    You and Boli arrive at Pizzaroni Toni's Mansion, a dark manor perpetually cloaked in shade, surrounded in a spiked
    fence.  You go up to the door and knock, a murder of crows start to cry out and disperse.  The sound of footsteps
    steadily get louder, until the door opens and Toni appears.  He is wearing the guise of a huggable man, with a broad
    smile, blue eyes, and jet-black hair.
    <br>
    "Oh, you again," Toni greets Boli, "brought another person to try and kill me?  Well, traveler, this isn't Boli's
    first time trying to supposedly get his business back.  All the others have, well, that isn't important."
    <br>
    A window on the top floor shatters, and a shrill shriek cries forth.
    <br>
    "Oh!  I suppose I must be going now," Toni excuses himself, and heads back inside.  His frame suddenly shifts to a
    shadowy outline, and he suddenly exudes dark magic.  The door slams shut, but no lock is heard clicking.
